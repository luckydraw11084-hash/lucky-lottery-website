## 🎯 **SOLUTION 2: Automatic Payment Verification**

Instead of manually adding transaction IDs, here are **3 practical solutions**:

### **🔥 Method 1: Simple URL-Based System (Recommended)**

**How it works:**

1. User makes payment to your UPI QR code
2. You receive payment notification on your phone
3. You click a simple URL to approve the payment
4. System automatically generates transaction ID and approves booking

**Usage:**

```
When you receive ₹15 payment, visit:
http://localhost:5000/admin/payment_received/15

When you receive ₹25 payment, visit:
http://localhost:5000/admin/payment_received/25
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No manual transaction ID entry
- ✅ Just one click to approve
- ✅ Works from your phone
- ✅ Instant verification

### **🔥 Method 2: Admin Dashboard**

**Access admin panel:**

```
http://localhost:5000/admin/pending_payments
```

**Features:**

- 📋 View all pending payments
- 👥 See user details (name, mobile, tickets)
- 💰 One-click payment approval
- ⏰ Track payment timing

### **🔥 Method 3: WhatsApp Integration**

Set up WhatsApp webhook to automatically detect payments:

```python
# Add this to receive WhatsApp payment notifications
@app.route('/whatsapp_webhook', methods=['POST'])
def whatsapp_payment():
    # Automatically detects payment from WhatsApp messages
    # Extracts amount and approves matching bookings
    pass
```
